# Typing-Test
This CLI program allows you to test your typing skills - how accurately you can type, how fast you can type. You can either login or register and type a random generated paragraph from OpenAI which you have to type. Your credentials will get stored in one table, your speed and accuracy will get stored in another table. You can access both by MySQL.
